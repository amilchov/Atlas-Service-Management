 1. Establish a theme for the project.
 2. Concluding a contract with the CERN.
 3. Gathering the materials we need.
 4. Exploration of Atlas Experiment and BigPanda data.
 5. Building a functional plan.
 6. Choice of technologies according to the developed functional plan.
 7. Building a logical plan for the selected technologies.
